# perror

a tiny little python module, implementing a numerical type with a defined error that is
propagated in calculations using gaussian error propagation.

not fast.
not accurate.
not applicable to a large class of problems.

but for the case where u need to calculate shit for uni and are to lazy to manually calculate the resulting uncertainty, this might be nice to have.
